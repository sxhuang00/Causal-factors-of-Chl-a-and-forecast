uic_surrogate includes codes conducting causality test between environmental factors and Chl-a with seasonal surrogate. The methods is information-theoretic causality (UIC) (Osada et al., 2023)


mdr_smap includes codes conducting Chl-a forecast using univariate model (Chl-a only) and mutivariate model (Chl-a + environmental factors). The method is multiview distance regularised S-map (Chang et al., 2021)


data_epd includes raw data of in situ measurement collected by HKEPD (https://cd.epic.epd.gov.hk/EPICRIVER/marine/?lang=en) in 76 sites. Sampling was conducted on one date of each month (interval not constant).


data_modis includes raw data of remote sensing by MODIS (https://oceandata.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/l3/) in 101 sites. Monthly data is average of daily data. The spatial resolution is 4km.


Both dataset are monthly data starting from 2002/08 to 2022/07.
